# LSW-SE

The LSW-SE (LEGO Star Wars Save Editor) is a tool used for modifying save files for LEGO Star Wars games and modifying the checksum so that they bypass the games corruption checks

## What can I use it on?

At the moment, there is only support for the following formats

### LEGO Star Wars: The Complete Saga
- PC

## How to use?

Download and run the .exe found in the [Releases](https://github.com/QueenPolly/LSW-SE/releases) tab. Then go to File > Open and select a save file. The editor will automatically create a backup of the selected file.

From there you can either regenerate the checksum of your save so that it can work in game, or unlock all the characters on that save file. Once you are done, go to File > Save and save the file. 

## Finding your save files?

Save files should be located at "%LOCALAPPDATA%\LucasArts\LEGO Star Wars - The Complete Saga\SavedGames"
